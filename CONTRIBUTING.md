## Getting Started

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following setup:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed
- Git installed and set up
- A Discord account with a bot set up
- Access to a PostgreSQL database
  - We use Supabase, you can use whatever you want but it's better tested there

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Nuit.git
cd Nuit
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

4. Create a `.env` file based on the [SELFHOSTING.md](./SELFHOSTING.md#environment-variables) and [.env.example](./.env.example) instructions

5. Run the bot in development mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent formatting using Prettier
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project

### Naming Conventions

- File names: camelCase (e.g., `myFile.ts`)
- Variable names: camelCase (e.g., `clientReady`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`)

## Making new Modules

> [!NOTE]
> This applies only to first-party modules. For third-party ones, you can also follow this but use a Git repo instead of step 1 and remove the `nuit` field in step 2.

Making a new module is simple:

1. Create a new file in the `src/modules/[moduleName]` directory

2. Add the following to a `package.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "@nuit-bot/module-[moduleName]", // the module's name, preferably the one put in the directory from step 1
    "main": "main.ts", // main entry point relative to `src/modules/[moduleName]`
    "nuit": {
        "kind": "" // "internal", "essential", "optional"
    }
}
```

3. Follow the structure of existing commands as a template

Best example is [the main internal module](./src/modules/main/main.ts)

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a new branch off `main` for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): short description"
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`  
**Scopes:** `discord`, `server`, `web`, `modules`, or a specific module name

```bash
# Examples
git commit -m "feat(modules): add welcome message module"
git commit -m "fix(discord): handle missing guild member intent"
```

5. Push your branch and open a PR targeting `main`:

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

> Direct commits to `main` are not allowed.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Use a clear title following the same convention as commits (`type(scope): description`)
- Explain what changed and why in the description
- Reference any related issues
- Keep PRs focused -- one feature or fix per PR
- Update docs if your change needs it
- AI-generated PRs are allowed, but may be deprioritized for review
- Larger PRs take longer to review -- when possible, split them up

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the established style guidelines
- [ ] Changes are tested and working properly
- [ ] Commits follow the Conventional Commits format
- [ ] Documentation has been updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly flagged and reviewed by a trusted contributor

## Issues

Before opening an issue, check if it's already been reported.

### Reporting Bugs

- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Include steps to reproduce
- Describe what you expected vs. what actually happened
- Attach any relevant error messages or logs
- Specify your environment (Bun version, OS, etc.)

### Suggesting Features
